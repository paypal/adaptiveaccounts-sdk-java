IPN Overview :
------------
* PayPal Instant Notification is a call back system that will get initiated once a tranction is completed(eg: When 
a PayPal account is created successfully).
* You will receive the transaction related ipn variables on your call back url that you have specified in your request.
* You have to send this ipn variable back to PayPal system for verification, Upon verification PayPal will send
a response string "VERIFIED" or "INVALID".
* PayPal will continuously resend this ipn, if a wrong ipn is sent.

IPN configuration :
-----------------
* Initialize IPNMessage constructor with a configuration map containing, mode (sandbox or live) and connection parameters as shown below.
   ```java
		Map<String,String> configMap = new HashMap<String,String>();
		
		// Endpoints are varied depending on whether sandbox OR live is chosen for mode
		configMap.put("mode", "sandbox");
		
		// Connection Information. These values are defaulted in SDK. If you want to override default values, uncomment it and add your value.
		// configMap.put("http.ConnectionTimeOut", "5000");
		// configMap.put("http.Retry", "2");
		// configMap.put("http.ReadTimeOut", "30000");
		// configMap.put("http.MaxConnection", "100");
			
		IPNMessage ipnlistener = new IPNMessage(request,configMap);
    ```
* IPNMessage is provided in 'sdk-core-java' repository. IPN Listener can use this class for message validation.
